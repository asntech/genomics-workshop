Data Carpentry workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze , and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

The focus of this workshop will be on working with genomics data and data management and analysis for genomics research. We will cover metadata organization in spreadsheets, data organization, connecting to and using cloud computing, the command line for sequence quality control and bioinformatics workflows, and R for data analysis and visualization. We will not be teaching any particular bioinformatics tools, but the foundational skills that will allow you to conduct any analysis and analyze the output of a genomics pipeline.


> ## Data
> 
> In this workshop we're using data from Blount et al 2012 paper from Dr. Richard Lenski's Long Term Evolution Experiment.

## Teaching Platforms
In its current form, the workshop can be run on pre-imaged AWS instances, Cyverse instances, or data & directories built on a local compute cluster.

> ## Platforms Details
>
> #### Amazon instance for workshop
> 
> All the software and data used in the workshop is on an Amazon AMI.
> 
> If you want to run your instance of the server used for this workshop, launch a t2.medium instance in the **N. Virginia** region with AMI **ami-aab445c7**, available under "Community AMIs" in the Amazon EC2 Management Console. Information on how to launch an instance can be found on our [Discussion page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/cloud-genomics/blob/gh-pages/lessons/1.logging-onto-cloud.md)

### Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow.
*These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but working
through this lesson requires working copies of the software described.
To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install everything
*before* working through this workshop.
