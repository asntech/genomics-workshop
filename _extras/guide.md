## Resouces for Instructors
We are preparing an onboarding video to prepare Instructors to teach this workshop. A link to this video will be added here
by mid-June 2019. After watching this video, please contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto: team@carpentries.org) so that we can record 
your status as an onboarded Instructor. Instructors who have completed onboarding will be given priority status for teaching at 
centrally-organized Carpentries workshops.
